Just made this site. Creating this post since otherwise I might forget how posts are created in here.

Hakyll is great, you literally (as in, in real life) don't need to know any web development to get this up and running. The only thing I know how to do is make a simple html website. Title! Body! So on. There was a time I made a half-hearted attepmt to get a site working with Ruby on Rails... This is much nicer. You literally (as in, in fantasy land) don't need to know how to program in order to use this site. As long as you can be trained to type a few things in the command line. Perhaps you can make an online wrapper for Hakyll and normal people can use it (or don't know if Wordpress, Tumblr, or Blogger is better, don't really know how they work).

Anyway, I've been looking through some of the Haskell files (actually there's probably only one) in here, and I officially declare Haskell a non-(programming) language. More seriously, it doesn't look like any language I know. I know...Python, Java, C, C++, you know, the usual. (I did try to make a site in Ruby on Rails without knowing Ruby. Ruby looks enough like Python, though.) And from what I hear, in order to truly understand Haskell you must know category theory...? Interesting language, will go on top of the pile of the rest of the things I must learn someday.

Written on the airplane without internet access, will go through and research the amibguous stuff later. First time in forever on an airplane this empty.

Not having internet access is nice. I must do this to myself sometimes.
